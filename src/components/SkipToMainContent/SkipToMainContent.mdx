# Skip to Main Content

The skip to main content link appears only to screen readers and users that are navigating using the keyboard. The link provides a shortcut for users to skip the header area and go directly to the main content. Without this feature, these users would have to repeatedly navigate through familiar header content from previous webpages.

Below is a preview of what the link looks like when focused in the browser.

## Guidance
* Place the Skip to main content link directly after the opening `<body>` tag.
